PREFACE

This distribution features the Perl 5 module named "CGI::Portable" as well as
these 5 other modules that are recommended for use with it:
CGI::Portable::Adapter[CGI|Socket],
CGI::Portable::App[Static|MultiScreen|SplitScreen].

All of my modules have complete POD inside of them, so please refer to that for a
description of the module itself.

This Read Me document concerns itself mainly with installation and support
issues, and also includes any "To Do" lists.

This distribution also includes 5 other modules, in the temporary name space 
Demo*, that are designed to be used with CGI::Portable.  Each of these is 
included as a demo "application component", and by looking at them, you should 
have a better idea what CGI::Portable can do for you.  Unlike ordinary demos, 
however, these are a lot more mature and are being used effectively in multiple 
production environments.  For all intents and purposes, you should treat them 
like "scripts" rather than "modules" as far as when you use them, due to their 
more proprietary nature.

This distribution now has a "demos" folder containing 46 files (including the
above 5 in a folder named "shared") which are ready-to-use example scripts and
data files that exercise CGI::Portable and all of the Demo* modules.  Many of
these are exactly the same as the *new* Synopsis POD for particular modules. 
Some have minor adjustments or demonstrate the Synopsis examples that make use
of the most features of the particular modules.  Many demos have extra files in
them that never appeared in Synopsis.  It is my hope that these demos will make
it an order of magnitude easier for you to adopt my modules and put them to
work in a productive manner.  The provided demos include: a multi-page web site
with usage tracking, guest books, mail and survey forms, static html and plain
text pages, segmented text file display, redirection, and a few other strange
modules that don't do anything useful but play with features. Any actual
modules in the demos folder are very immature and should not be used as is;
rather, learn from them.  They intentionally have no POD.  However, the modules
mentioned in the previous paragraph, in the "shared" folder, are more mature
and are ok to use productively, with the caveat that they will change.

KEEPING UP TO DATE

My module set is constantly under development.  You should be able to find the
newest versions at my website, "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net", on the page called
"Perl Libraries I Made" (name subject to change).  They can also be found on CPAN
under the author name of "DUNCAND".  

I am inclined to update the copies on my web site more often, but those
intermediate versions are more likely to have been tested less, and the modules
may be updated day by day without increasing the version numbers.  However, the
copies on CPAN are guaranteed to have unique version numbers when the module has
changed.

REQUIREMENTS

All of my modules require Perl 5.004 or newer, even though only some of them need
it, in the interest of consistency.  That said, Perl 5.004 is already 3 years 
old, is available as a binary on practically every OS that supports Perl at all, 
and is a very solid release, so I see no reason to support anything older.

Modules in this distribution require modules in these following distributions:

File-VirtualPath-1.011.tar.gz
	- by Darren Duncan (DUNCAND)
	- File::VirtualPath 1.011 is required by:
		- CGI::Portable (stores file-system related paths)
		- CGI::Portable (stores url related paths)

CGI-MultiValuedHash-1.09.tar.gz
	- by Darren Duncan (DUNCAND)
	- CGI::MultiValuedHash 1.09 is required by:
		- CGI::Portable (stores and url-decodes user queries, posts, cookies)

HTML-EasyTags-1.071.tar.gz
	- by Darren Duncan (DUNCAND)
	- HTML::EasyTags 1.071 is required by:
		- CGI::Portable (assembles the pieces of a new HTML page)

mod_perl-1.24_01.tar.gz (older versions may work):
	- Apache 1.27 is required by:
		- CGI::Portable::AdapterCGI (when running under mod_perl)

HTML-FormTemplate-2.021.tar.gz
	- by Darren Duncan (DUNCAND)
	- HTML::FormTemplate 2.021 is required by:
		- DemoMailForm (for making input forms and form reports)
		- DemoGuestBook (for making input forms and form reports)

libnet-1.0703.tar.gz (older versions may work):
	- by Graham Barr (GBARR)
	- Net::SMTP 2.15 is required by:
		- DemoMailForm (when sending e-mails of form data)
		- DemoGuestBook (when sending e-mails of form data)
		- DemoUsage (when sending e-mails of usage data)

GD (any version I suppose) is required by the "image" demo.

INSTALLATION

To install these modules, cd to the directory that contains all of the extracted 
distribution files, including this ReadMe file, and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The last step probably won't work if you are not the administrator of your 
machine; in that case you either need to get your administrator to install this 
for you, or put it in a your own local directory instead.

The Makefile.PL can do this for you if you substitute something like the 
following for the first line above:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/tmp/myperl5

or:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/myperl5

If you are on a Mac system that is older than Mac OS X (Mac OS 9 or earlier)
and/or you are otherwise having problems with the Makefile, you can still
install this module the old fashioned way, by copying.

Every file in the "lib" folder of this distribution goes in its corresponding 
location within the "lib" folder that came with your Perl 5 distribution.

Or alternately, put them anywhere you want, but you will need to have that 
location added to your include path by your main program using something like 
this:

	use lib '/home/me/myperl5/lib';

Then you would want to run the included test programs to make sure the modules
are installed correctly.  Call them like this:

	perl -w t/CGI-Portable.t

Any existing POD is embedded in the modules themselves.  The Makefile probably 
extracted it for you in the usual manner, or you can run a POD extractor on it 
yourself to the same effect.  You can also find an HTMLized copy of the POD on 
CPAN and other public source archives; I link to one copy of it on my web site.

SUPPORT

Currently I don't have any support arranged with other people, lists, newsgroups,
or otherwise.  Feel free to ask me if you can't figure things out on your own, or
another person whom you know has used this.  I may start a mailing list for 
support issues later, so that users of my modules can help each other with them.

TO DO

	* Add feature that lets one export a CGI::Portable application to a set of 
	static html files that can be used independantly of any script, except that 
	they would still call the script to process any forms.  This would consist 
	mainly of changing the self-referencing hyperlinks in generated screens.  
	Advantages are greatly improved performance for applications with mostly 
	static screens, including the initial page for forms.
	* Add feature that lets one have separate "development" and "production" 
	directories for application components or config files whereby equivalent 
	files in the production directory are used by default, but copies in the 
	development directory are used instead if they exist.  This makes it easier 
	for someone to change the application while it is in use without normal 
	users seeing the new version while it is being tested.
	* Add a battery of ok / not ok tests.
	* Improve the documentation.
	* I have few more ideas in this regard, but am open to suggestions.
	* Now all of my pre-conceived modules for public release are done, so all 
	I've got left to do in that regards is improve the existing ones.

I am always interested in knowing how my work helps others, so if you put this
module to use in any of your own products or services then I would appreciate
(but not require) it if you send me the website url for said product or
service, so I know who you are.  Also, if you make non-proprietary changes to
the module because it doesn't work the way you need, and you are willing to
make these freely available, then please send me a copy so that I can roll
desirable changes into the main release.
