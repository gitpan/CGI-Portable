PREFACE

This distribution features the Perl 5 module named "CGI::Portable".

It also includes 10 other modules that are designed to be used with it; these
10 are all in the temporary name space CGI::WPM::*.  Eight of them are
demo "application components", one performs user input and output, and one
encapsulates a file format for counting events.  By looking at those you should
have a better idea what CGI::Portable can do for you.

This distribution now has a "demos" folder containing 40 files and folders 
which are ready-to-use example scripts and data files that exercise 
CGI::Portable and all of the CGI::WPM::* modules.  Many of these are exactly 
the same as the *new* Synopsis POD for particular modules.  Some have minor 
adjustments or demonstrate the Synopsis examples that make use of the most 
features of the particular modules.  Many demos have extra files in them 
that never appeared in Synopsis.  It is my hope that these demos will 
make it an order of magnitude easier for you to adopt my modules and put 
them to work in a productive manner.  The provided demos include: a multi-page 
web site with usage tracking, guest books, mail and survey forms, static html 
and plain text pages, segmented text file display, redirection, and a few 
other strange modules that don't do anything useful but play with features.

All of my modules have complete POD inside of them, so please refer to that for a
description of the module itself.  Although the POD with this set isn't as
complete as I would like, it should still be suitable.  Mostly what is lacking 
is descriptions of each "preference" and what effect it has.  Hopefully the 
detailed Synopsis and demos will be self-explanatory on what the prefs do.
	
This Read Me document concerns itself mainly with installation and support
issues, and also includes any "To Do" lists.

KEEPING UP TO DATE

My module set is constantly under development.  You should be able to find the
newest versions at my website, "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net", on the page called
"Perl Libraries I Made" (name subject to change).  They can also be found on CPAN
under the author name of "DUNCAND".  

I am inclined to update the copies on my web site more often, but those
intermediate versions are more likely to have been tested less, and the modules
may be updated day by day without increasing the version numbers.  However, the
copies on CPAN are guaranteed to have unique version numbers when the module has
changed.

REQUIREMENTS

All of my modules require Perl 5.004 or newer, even though only some of them need
it, in the interest of consistency.  That said, Perl 5.004 is already 3 years 
old, is available as a binary on practically every OS that supports Perl at all, 
and is a very solid release, so I see no reason to support anything older.

Modules in this distribution require modules in these following distributions:

File-VirtualPath-1.0.tar.gz
	- by Darren Duncan (DUNCAND)
	- File::VirtualPath 1.0 is required by:
		- CGI::Portable (stores file-system and url related paths)

HTML-EasyTags-1.05.tar.gz
	- by Darren Duncan (DUNCAND)
	- HTML::EasyTags 1.05 is required by:
		- CGI::Portable (assembles the pieces of a new HTML page)

MultiValuedHash-1.07.tar.gz
	- by Darren Duncan (DUNCAND)
	- Data::MultiValuedHash 1.07 is required by:
		- CGI::Portable (stores new cookies prior to output)
	- CGI::MultiValuedHash 1.07 is required by:
		- CGI::Portable (stores and url-decodes user queries, posts, cookies)

HTML-FormTemplate-2.0.tar.gz
	- by Darren Duncan (DUNCAND)
	- HTML::FormTemplate 2.0 is required by:
		- CGI::WPM::MailForm (for making input forms and form reports)
		- CGI::WPM::GuestBook (for making input forms and form reports)

libnet-1.0703.tar.gz (older versions may work):
	- by Graham Barr (GBARR)
	- Net::SMTP 2.15 is required by:
		- CGI::WPM::MailForm (when sending e-mails of form data)
		- CGI::WPM::GuestBook (when sending e-mails of form data)
		- CGI::WPM::Usage (when sending e-mails of usage data)

mod_perl-1.24_01.tar.gz (older versions may work):
	- Apache 1.27 is required by:
		- CGI::WPM::SimpleUserIO (when running under mod_perl)

GD (any version I suppose) is required by the "image" demo.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, cd to the directory that contains all of the extracted 
distribution files, including this ReadMe file, and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The last step probably won't work if you are not the administrator of your 
machine; in that case you either need to get your administrator to install this 
for you, or put it in a your own local directory instead.

If you are on a Mac system and/or you are otherwise having problems with the 
Makefile, you can still install this module the old fashioned way, by copying.

The file "Portable.pm" goes inside the "CGI" folder which is in the "lib" 
folder that came with your Perl 5 distribution.  All of the other .pm modules 
go inside the temporary folder "WPM", which is inside "CGI", which is in the 
"lib" folder that came with your Perl 5 distribution.

Or alternately, put it anywhere you want, but you will need to have that 
location added to your include path by your main program using something like 
this:

	use lib '/users/me/www_files/lib';

Then you would want to run the included test program to make sure the module is 
installed correctly.  Call it with:

	perl test.pl

Any existing POD is embedded in the module itself.  The Makefile probably 
extracted it for you in the usual manner, or you can run a POD extractor on it 
yourself to the same effect.  You can also find an HTMLized copy of the POD on 
CPAN and other public source archives; I link to one copy of it on my web site.

SUPPORT

Currently I don't have any support arranged with other people, lists, newsgroups,
or otherwise.  Feel free to ask me if you can't figure things out on your own, or
another person whom you know has used this.  I may start a mailing list for 
support issues later, so that users of my modules can help each other with them.

TO DO

	* Add a battery of ok / not ok tests.
	* Improve the documentation.
	* I have few more ideas in this regard, but am open to suggestions.
	* Now all of my pre-conceived modules for public release are done, so all 
	I've got left to do in that regards is improve the existing ones.
